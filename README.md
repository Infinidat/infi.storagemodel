Overview
========

A cross-plaform storage management library in Python.
See http://storagemodel.readthedocs.org/en/develop/index.html for the complete documentation.

Checking out the code
=====================

This project uses buildout, and git to generate setup.py and __version__.py.
In order to generate these, run:

    python -S bootstrap.py -d -t
    bin/buildout -c buildout-version.cfg
    python setup.py develop

In our development environment, we use isolated python builds, by running the following instead of the last command:

    bin/buildout install development-scripts
